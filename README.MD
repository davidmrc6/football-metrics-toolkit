## Installation
```bash
npm install football-metrics-toolkit
```

## Quick Start
To import the `FootballMetricsClient` and make a query, follow the example provided below:
```javascript
import { FootballMetricsClient } from 'football-metrics-toolkit';

const client = new FootballMetricsClient();

const data = await client.fetchTable({
    league: 'ligue-1',
    season: '2023-2024',
    tables: [
        TableType.OVERALL_STANDINGS,
        TableType.SQUAD_STATS.STANDARD.FOR,
        TableType.SQUAD_STATS.ADVANCED_GOALKEEPING.FOR
    ],
    teams: ['Paris S-G', 'Lille'],
    cols: ['team', 'wins', 'xg_for', 'gk_psxg_net_per90']
});

console.log(data);
```
Expected response:
```bash
{
  'Paris S-G': { wins: '22', xg_for: '68.8', gk_psxg_net_per90: '+0.24' },
  Lille: { wins: '16', xg_for: '48.6', gk_psxg_net_per90: '+0.16' }
}
```
Whilte the client is fetching data live logs and warnings will be printed on the console. To disable these warnings, pass in the `{ console = false }` parameter when initializing the client, i. e.
```javascript
const client = new FootballMetricsClient({ console: false });
```
When quering for opponent data, the requested statistics must begin with the prefix `against_`:
```javascript
const data = await client.fetchTable({
    league: 'premier-league',
    season: '2020-2021',
    // no `tables` parameter, client defaults to extracting data from all possible tables
    team: 'Arsenal',
    cols: ['gk_psxg_net_per90', 'against_gk_psxg_net_per90']
})
```
Expected response:
``` bash
{
  Arsenal: { gk_psxg_net_per90: '+0.03', against_gk_psxg_net_per90: '-0.14' }
}
```
You can also convert the output to CSV format and save it to a `.csv` file:
```javascript
import { converToCSV, saveToCSV } from 'football-metrics-toolkit';

const csv = convertToCSV(data);
await saveToCSV(csv, 'football.csv');
```
